# File Selection and Auto Complete in Python

This is a simple script demonstrating file selection using the Tkinter GUI. It demonstrates tab auto-completion and file name validation.

Files can be selected by typing a file name or using the file dialog window. Upon selecting a file, the name will be validated. The entry box will turn green or red indicating if a valid file has been selected.
